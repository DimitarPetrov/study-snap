**Study Snap** is a multi-platform mobile application written with [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter).

Gallery apps are designed for personal everyday photos, kept in timeline manner, they are not a perfect match for school subject/topic divided photos.
Exactly that is the purpose of **Study Snap**. It is designed for saving photos divided in subjects and nested topics hierarchy well organised and much easier to find and read.

**Study Snap** mission is to help students by providing easy way to transfer all photos of study materials from their gallery apps to well organised list of subjects with multiple topic albums. It makes their galleries much cleaner with only personal photos and their study materials much more organised and easier to maintain.

You can create multiple subjects and in each of them to have as much as you like topics containing a set of photos for the topic. This makes photos not only easier to find but much more efficient to learn as every photo is in its own context. You can also create photos directly in a topic without going to the gallery app or include photo from it.
When a photo is uploaded to Study Snap it is free to be deleted from gallery, don't worry **Study Snap** keeps a separate copy of it in your internal storage.
