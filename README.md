## Overview

**Study Snap** is a multi-platform mobile application written with [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter).
It is designed to help students by providing easy way to transfer all photos of study material
from their gallery apps to well organized, user defined topic albums in the application
or directly take a photo in one of them. It makes their galleries much cleaner with only personal photos and their
study materials much more organized and easier to maintain. As gallery apps are designed for personal
everyday photos, kept in timeline manner, they are not a perfect match for school/university
subject/topic devided photos. Exactly that is the pourpose of ***Study Snap*** it is designet exactly for saving photos
divided in subjects and nested topics hierarchy well organized and much easier to find and read. When a photo is uploded
to ***Study Snap*** it is free to be deleted from gallery, dont worry ***Study Snap*** keeps a separate copy of it in your
internal storage.
