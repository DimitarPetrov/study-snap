## Study Snap - Photo Management for Students Privacy policy

Welcome to the `Study Snap - Photo Management for Students` app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Dimitar Petrov. The source code is available on GitHub under the MIT license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As a developer, I take privacy very seriously.

Therefore, I have not implemented collection of any personally identifiable information in the app.
All photos added to Study Snap are stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

The only data that Study Snap shares is the one needed by the ad provider - `Google AdMob`. You can see more [here](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/play-data-disclosure#data_collected_and_shared_automatically).

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, do not hesitate to send me an email.
